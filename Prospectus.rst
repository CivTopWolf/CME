Products

Strategy and Opportunity

Business

We generate revenue by connecting buyers and sellers.

    Our revenue was $603.8 million, $844.8 million, and $1,106.8 million in
    2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, representing an annual growth rate of
    40% and 31%, respectively. We generated net losses of $325.9 million, $210.2
    million, and $111.7 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.

Capital Structure

There is only one class of common stock. All holders of common stock are
entitled to one vote on matters submitted to our stockholders.

Business
********************************************************************************

The CME is a commodity market maker; it makes money by charging a fee for
connecting buyers and sellers. This differentiates it from other shops in two
important ways:

1. Most shops only sell items; they do not also buy them. When a shop only sells
   items, the incentive of the shopkeeper is to charge the highest price he
   can sell an item for. This means many shops charge "unfair" prices, and,
   consequently, are not useful most of the time, nor very profitable.

   In contrast, market makers make money by reselling items. This is most likely
   to happen if prices are approximately fair to everyone involved.

2. Shops that only sell items require a large amount of maintenance. If the shop
   runs out stock, the shopkeeper must gather more materials.

   In contrast, market makers never runs out of stock. There is always a way to
   interact with them.

The CME generates revenue by collecting a fee when it connects a buyer to a
seller. There are two ways we collect fees: through spreads, and though CME
tokens. The decision to use a spread or CME tokens depends on the value of the
item.

Tokens
================================================================================

CME tokens are a form of debt. Customers buy CME tokens to spend in the shop,
similar to an arcade, and can redeem tokens back into the currency (hence a
debt). In this case, tokens are pegged to iron, so 1 $CME can be redeemed for 1
iron. However, there is a fee to purchase tokens: 32 iron buys only 31 $CME, a
3% fee.

CME tokens can be combined with exchange tests that also capture a spread, but
at present we chose not to do so, because spreads limit the `efficiency` of the
exchange.

We need to be careful if we let people exchange tokens for two different types
of items. Traders who trade daily may evade fees by never redeeming tokens. If
someone sells diamonds for CME tokens and then buys an XP block for the CME
token, we will not have collected any fees. If a second person then sells XP
blocks for tokens and buy diamonds, we will have enabled a trade without
collecting any fees. If we had not used tokens, we would have had collected two
fees (in the spreads) instead of 0.

Risk Factors
********************************************************************************

Investing in shares involves a degree of risk. You should consider carefully the
risks and uncertainties described below.

In some loose order of how serious I think these threats are, from least
threatening to most threatening:

#. People may move away from the #.,+, and be unwilling to travel to the CME.

#. MTA citizens may vote in laws that hurt the CME.

#. We may get raided and have chests destroyed. If raided by an organized
   group, they could defend the area and acid#.block the whole shop.

#. We may get griefed with obsidian. This would close the shop down for several
   days until the grief can be removed.

#. Romec owns the plot, and may force us off of it or attempt to charge rent.
   The more valuable the CME becomes, the more of a problem this could become.

#. The thesis that people will be willing to travel if there is large stock may
   be false.

#. A competitor may arise and steal away transactions, by offering reduced fees
   or being accessible in a more convenient location.

#. People may not understand CME tokens

#. People may learn that holding CME tokens enables them to trade certain item
   pairs without fees

#. If the CME token printing plate is destroyed, we will be unable to print new
   tokens (or we will need a system for people to exchange them for each other)

#. If the CME token printing plate is stolen, we will need to disable all
   exchanges that use them before the thief can

#. We have a short operating history, and metrics are hard to capture. Errors
   in our metrics could result in incorrect business decisions.

#. The shop steward can commit fraud by underreporting the amount of profit.
   For example, if a customer sells 10 diamonds for 10i each, and a second
   customer buys each of those 10 diamonds for 11i each, the shop should have
   made 10i in profit. However, the steward could remove the 10i from the
   chest, and it would appear as if those transactions never happened.

#. The shop steward could empty the shop chests and run away.

Market, industry, and other data
********************************************************************************

One other diamond exchanges on the ground floor of the MTA mall, owned by
Olivay. He makes no profit from it. This has the effect of reducing the total
number of buyers and sellers we will connect.

Rather than viewing this as a threat, I view this as an ally- it increase the
total supply of iron and diamonds available for trading in MTA, which should
make it more attractive for people to travel further distances to do large
trades.

A second exchange was built by Jinyo_Robin in Commonwealth before the Somber
War, but Jinyo removed all the stock before becoming inactive.

There are some chests that let people exchange diamonds and iron, but they are
set up as single chests, and usually become useless as soon as the market for
iron changes. Some examples include the Hjaltland shops in Yoahtl, Commonwealth,
and MTA.

In the case of XP and other commodities, we compete with anyone who is selling
the materials directly. Anyone who purchases at a shop that sells the same item
we are trading is a lost opportunity for us.

Use of proceeds
********************************************************************************

The CME stores 10-12 diamonds worth of items in each exchange chest, and each
exchange consists of 13 exchange chests. So about 130-156d per row.

- Buy 2 bastions and secure them in obsidian at bedrock. This will require
  working with Romec - they may need to be property of the mall in order to
  avoid interfering with other shops below.

- Add 2 more rows of diamond exchanges. This will require 10 * 13 *
  2 = 260 diamonds plus 13 * 2 = 26 double chests. The estimated cost of this
  is 312 diamonds.

- Add 8 rows of XP blocks. This will require 13 * 6 * 8 = 624 XP blocks, and 13
  * 6 = 78 double chests. The estimated value of this is 624 * 2 + 78 * 2 =
  1404 diamonds.

- Increase the supply of core XP ingredients (e.g sand)

- Increase the supply of key bastion ingredients (e.g. gold, redstone, lapiz)

  In addition to possibly being profitable, this would give the server a
  good estimate on how valuable mining is, and the opportunity cost of doing
  anything else. This is also important for security, since it informs how many
  diamonds can be safely stored in a shop chest.

- Increase the supply of logs. Logs have constant demand.

The two ongoing expenses we need to pay are the shop steward who is
responsible for:

1. Adding, removing, and editing exchanges

2. Periodically creating balance sheets

If we assume it takes about 5 seconds to do an operation on a chest, and there
are 13 chests in an exchange, then it should take about a minute to a perform
an operation on every chest in an exchange.

Capitalization
********************************************************************************

Balance sheet
================================================================================

As of Nov 13, 2018, the estimated value of the CME assets is 1160 diamonds. This
was calculating by summing 1) the total number of diamonds and iron stored in
the exchange chests, 2) the costs of the chests themselves, and 3) the costs of
the CME tokens.

Dilution
********************************************************************************

Management
********************************************************************************

Finanical metrics
================================================================================

Fees are always collected as iron. In order to convert profits back into
diamonds, we need to buy diamonds from our own exchange.

It is difficult to collect financial metrics on the shop.

Security
================================================================================

My philosophy on security is that the only effective security is that which can
be publicly revealed and still work.

I do not consider bounties an effective form of security. Thieves today use
alts, and even if they did not, bounties are expensive to place.

The CME stores items all items in double chest reinforced with two diamonds
each. This means it takes 10 minutes to break into a double-diamond reinforced
chest using either an E4 or E5 diamond axe, both of which can break a chest in
0.15 seconds. [3]_ I had previously calculated that a person could generate 3
diamonds per minute from mining. If that is true, the maximum value that can be
safely stored is 30 diamonds. There are different factors that affect this, in
particular the probability of being caught, and the mining skill of the
attacker.

The CME also has snitches throughout the shop, some of which are surrounded by
diamond-reinforced obsidian. These form a chain, so there is no way to remove
a snitch without being caught by another snitch. At present, each floor of the
shop uses four snitches in each of the corners.

Snitches get culled if nobody with the permission to ``LIST_SNITCHES`` goes near
the snitches every so often. [2]_ It may be possible to give public access to a
subset of the snitches to prevent snitches from ever culling, so long as this
does not give people the ability to clear the logs.

The CME does not have bastions, which means the shop can be obby-griefed and
acid-blocked. Obby grief could disable the shop for hours or days. The shop was
acid-blocked in June 2018, and nobody noticed for at least a day. [1]_

The CME printing plate, if compromised, would require a new set of tokens to be
produced, and could lead to loss if we do not disable all chests that use them
before the attacker prints out tokens. Since CME tokens are used in 2
exchanges, the total value that could be lost if an attacker steals the
printing plate, prints tokens, and exchanges them for real items could be up to
2 * 13 * 12 = 312 diamonds. In addition, the CME tokens would need to be
replaced, which would cost about 50 diamonds.

The biggest potential threats to the CME are internal rather than external.
Anyone who has access to the shop chests can severely hurt the CME in multiple
ways:

1. By stealing items from all chests they have access to

2. By under-reporting profits

I see no simple way to protect against either of these threats. One option may
may be to hold the pearls of anyone who has access to chests. Another option
may be to insure the shop chests. (The insurance for this could be put up for
auction. [4]_)
